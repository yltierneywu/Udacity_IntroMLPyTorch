# Udacity_IntroMLPyTorch

These are the notebooks that were part of the Udacity course "Intro to Machine Learning with Pytorch" that I successfully completed in January 2022. There were three projects:
1. Finding Donors for Charity ML, which was a supervised learning task
2. Creating an image classifier by building a neural network to evaluate the CIFAR-10 dataset
3. Identifying Customer Segments, which was an unsupervised learning task

A template Jupyter notebook with parts of the code was provided. The projects entailed adding code such to perform the machine learning tasks. The resulting notebooks are in this repository. For the first project a python script "visuals.py" was also provided by Udacity.
